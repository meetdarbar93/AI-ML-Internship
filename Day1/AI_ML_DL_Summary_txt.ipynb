        "AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a broad field of computer science that aims to create machines or systems capable of performing tasks that normally require human intelligence — such as reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and understanding language.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Idea:\n",
        "AI = Machine that thinks and acts like humans.\n",
        "\n",
        "Examples:\n",
        "\n",
        "Chatbots (like ChatGPT or Siri): They understand human language and respond intelligently to user queries.\n",
