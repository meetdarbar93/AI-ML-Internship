        "**SVM Basics** : Understand how SVM separates classes using maximum margin and how different kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial) help in non-linear classification.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Kernel Trick** : Know how kernels transform data into higher dimensions to make separation easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Hyperparameters** :  Learn why tuning parameters like C, gamma, and kernel improves model performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Random Forest Concept** : Understand ensemble learning, especially bagging, where many decision trees work together for better accuracy and stability.\n",

        "**Evaluation Importance**: A single train-test score is not reliable; use k-Fold Cross-Validation for stable performance measurement.\n",

        "**Metrics**: Learn to read confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and feature importance.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Practical ML Skills** : Train SVM and Random Forest in sklearn, apply GridSearchCV for tuning, and compare multiple models fairly on the same data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**ML Engineering Mindset**: Know when to choose simple vs complex models, how tuning changes performance, detect overfitting, and understand the importance of scalable evaluation methods like cross-validation."
